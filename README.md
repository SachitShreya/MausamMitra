# Weather Report App Backend

This README file provides information about the backend of the Weather Report application, which is built using Python and a web framework (Flask or FastAPI). The backend handles API requests to fetch weather data from a free open-source API and serves the necessary endpoints for the frontend.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd weather-report-app/backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

   The server will start, and you can access the API at `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified in your app).

## API Endpoints

- **GET /weather?location={location}**
  - Description: Fetches the weather report for the specified location.
  - Query Parameters:
    - `location`: The name of the city or location for which to retrieve the weather.
  - Response: Returns a JSON object containing weather data.

## Usage Example

To get the weather for a specific location, you can make a GET request to the endpoint:

```
GET http://localhost:8000/weather?location=London
```

The response will include details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
